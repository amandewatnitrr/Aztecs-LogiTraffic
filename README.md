# Aztecs-LogiTraffic
LogiTraffic is an IoT based Deep Learning Powered Traffic Management and Theft Detection Solution. It’s an online website platform using which user can keep check on certain real-time parameters associated with the vehicle which includes fuel-level, GPS location, Brake System Temperature, Speed, Traffic Forecasting using Vehicle Detection and obtaining vehicle count through different road nodes and predicting Traffic Congestion/Jams. In case the user suspects his/her car has been stolen by logging in using the credentials one can lock the vehicles and see driver’s real time video stream and a picture of the driver is downloaded on the system so that it can be used for further investigation and police cases.
